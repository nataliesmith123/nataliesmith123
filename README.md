### Hello!

My work aims to advance public health by improving the adoption and implementation of evidence-informed programs and policies. I have developed a research program to support this mission that emphasizes applying a variety of decision science methods to implementation and dissemination related questions, including economic evaluation, simulation modeling, and stated preference methods. Substantively, my research program spans multiple areas of chronic disease prevention; my current projects relate to weight management and tobacco use. 

I am a current cancer prevention [postdoc fellow](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cancer-prevention-fellowship/people/natalie-smith/) at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. I'm mentored by Dr. Doug Levy and Dr. Karen Emmons. 

I also work with Dr. Davene Wright as a [Pyle Fellow](https://twitter.com/DeptPopMed/status/1556701937537585153) in the Department of Population Medicine/Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. 

I completed my PhD in 2021 in Health Policy and Management at UNC Chapel Hill in the Gillings School of Global Public Health, under the direction of Leah Frerichs. My main area of focus was Decision Sciences and Outcomes Research. From 2018-2021 I was a predoctoral trainee at the Carolina Population Center. The training program focuses on helping PhD students integrate approaches from the social and health sciences to address important public health problems. Before that, I earmed my MS in Biostatistics, also from UNC Chapel Hill.
