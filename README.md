### Hello!

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh. My work aims to advance public health by generating tools and evidence to inform program and policy decision making. I have developed a research program to support this mission that emphasizes applying a variety of decision science methods such as stated preference methods, economic evaluation, simulation modeling, and other decision analysis approaches. I am also trained in systems thinking, biostatistics, network analysis, health services research, and econometrics. Substantively, my research program spans multiple areas of chronic disease prevention; my current projects relate to tobacco control and prevention and public health nutrition. 

I completed my PhD in 2021 in Health Policy and Management at UNC Chapel Hill in the Gillings School of Global Public Health. Before that, I earned my MS in Biostatistics, also from UNC Chapel Hill.
